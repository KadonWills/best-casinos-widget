# best-casinos-widget
A Responsive Call-To-Action widget For the best online casinos.

## How I Approached The Problem
 - I started by having an overview of each display according to the various breakpoint (i.e. Desktop view, mobile view, tablet view)
 
 - I moved foward to identify each group of element as a component to breakdown the overall design into small reusable parts

 - I henceforth used each of this UI components on the main component, thereby regrouping them to build the overall widget

 - I used a mobile-first approach and once i completed the mobile view,  i went foward adapting each component's for each breakpoint to obtain the final required responsive result.
